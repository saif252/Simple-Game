# Simple Games

A collection of small, fun, and beginner-friendly games I built while learning programming.  
Each game is simple, console-based, and focuses on core programming logic.  
More games will be added as I continue learning and experimenting.

## 🎮 Games Included

### **Rock–Paper–Scissors**
A classic game where the player competes against the computer by choosing between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

### **Number Guessing Game**
The computer selects a random number and the player tries to guess it within an unlimited number of attempts.
